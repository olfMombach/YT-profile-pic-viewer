# YT-profile-pic-viewer
 This is a (Firefox) Addon that shows YouTube profile pictures in full size when hovering over them in the comment section.
 It is built using the WebExtension API cross-browser technology (so is most likely compatible with Chrome and other, more insignificant browsers such as Edge or Internet Explorer (?) ), however as of now it is only published on the Mozilla Firefox Addons market.
